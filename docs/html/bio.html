        <h1>What I Care About</h1>
        <h3>Distributed Systems</h3>
        <p>
            I'm drawn to systems where performance, correctness, and scale intersect.
        </p>
        <h3>Infrastructure & Transportation</h3>
        <p>
            I'm deeply interested in how software supports real-world infrastructure,
            especially rail systems and regional connectivity in the U.S.
        </p>
        <h3>Building Things That Last</h3>
        <p>
            I value engineering that is durable, understandable, and meaningful.
